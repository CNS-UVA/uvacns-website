		<h2>The CNS Network</h2>
		<p>CNS is the only computer science club at the University that hosts its own computing infrastructure. Our cluster is located in Rice Hall and runs Proxmox VE with a Ceph storage backend. We use it to host everything from our website and documentation to mock networks for cyber defense practices.</p>

	<div>
		<h2>The Cyber Range</h2>
		<p>CNS is currently in the process of building the UVA Cyber Range, a state-of-the-art computing environment to experiment with cybersecurity techniques in a controlled setting. Funded by <a href="https://jeffersontrust.org/tag/uva-cyber-range/">over $70,000 in grants from the Jefferson Trust</a>, the Cyber Range allows UVA students to spin up and tear down virtual machines and networks, enabling them to gain cybersecurity experience without owning expensive hardware. The Cyber Range is almost complete and we hope to make it available to club members by the Fall 2025 semester.</p>
