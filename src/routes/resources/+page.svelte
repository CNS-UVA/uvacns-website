                CNS hosts a wide range of events throughout the semester. Our biggest event is <b><a href="https://cyberstorm.uvacns.com">CyberStorm</a></b>, a day-long, realistic cybersecurity competition that teaches you the skills to defend against cyber attacks in a red/blue team scenario. We host weekly meetings to cover basics in networking and security, participate in Capture The Flags together, and break a lot of things!
